/**TODO
 *  1. Display a webpage with a "Simulate" button. This executes the driver with two premade sample decks and provides text output on the screen.
 *  2. Add in a form that allows users to modify the content of either deck. Clicking "Simulate" now runs the user-created decks against each other.
 *  3/4. Update the output from pure text to basic drawn visuals (two HP boxes, icons for attacks).
 *  3/4. Add a "Queue" button. This takes the content of the first deck and matches against another user visiting the site which has also hit the "Queue" button. 
 *      Because there is no player interaction once the deck is locked in, this hopefully shouldn't be too hard? The match should still run on the server, though, so that they both see the same result.
 *          However, future extensibility should be kept in mind. There is a once-per-game feature that allows a player to break turn order and immediately queue a preselected Chip.
